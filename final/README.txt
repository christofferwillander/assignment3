In order to create shared library file 'libfunctions.so' in directory 'lib'
and compiler executable 'calc3i.exe' in directory 'bin', use the make file - or 
just simply run the 'x86-64-driver.sh' script on a .calc file. The driver makes
the files for you before compilation if they do not already exist.
